LIIIKES -- http://liiikes.com

Liiikes, a simple app that utilizes the Dribbble API, was built by Adam Darowski and Jeffrey Chupp.
For updates, you can follow @liiikesapp on Twitter.

You can read more about the app and the tech stack here:  http://liiikes.com/about

Note:  This was a fun little hobby app thrown together in some free time.  As
a result it certainly doesn't represent Jeffrey's best effort (gasp, no tests!).
There's plenty of room for improvement :)
