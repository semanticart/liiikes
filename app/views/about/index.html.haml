%h2#about-laa About Likes Above Average (LAA)
%p Likes Above Average (LAA) is the metric used to build the Liiikes leaderboards. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.baseballprojection.com/war/statdef.htm">Wins Above Replacement model</a> that's all the rage in the baseball sabermetrics community, LAA calculates how many more "Likes" a Dribbble player receives than the average player.
